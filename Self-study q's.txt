1. the ".forEach" will count each individual item in an array, but will need
a function to return the array. the ".map" will take an array and return it
into a new array.

2. a function contains variables and perameters to compute an output. a method
is associated with a class and is just like a function.

3. closure is when you are not able to access anything inside of a function from anywhere else outside the function unless you call the function.

4.
	Global Binding will grab the window or console object.

	Implicit Binding will grab the object and look incide to look for what is
	dot notated next to it.

	New Binding will create a new object that the takes each "this" and make it
	so that they can be used in multiple methods.

	Explicit Binding will make it so that methods can be interchangable and/or
	overwritten.

5.  the super method is used to call the constructor of the base class. without
	the super method, the extended class could not take in the constructor
	properties from the base class.
